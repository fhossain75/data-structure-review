Code practice of all data structures

## Linear Data Structures

### ArrayLists
**Operations**: Insert (Add front/back), Delete (Remove front/back), Search, Update

### Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Circular Doubly Linked List
  
**Operations**: Insert (Add front/back), Delete (Remove front/back), Search, Update

### Stacks
**Description**: Last In First Out; Removes the most recently added data
- Linked List Backed
- Array Backed

**Operations**: Push, Pop, isEmpty, isFull, Peek, Clear

### Queues
Description: First In First Out; Removes the least recently added data (first data)
- Linked List Backed
- Array Backed
Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, isEmpty, isFull, Peek, Clear

### Deques
Description: Double-ended queue; not for searching or accessing
Operations: Insert (Add front/last), Delete (Remove front/last)

### Circular Queues

### Hash Table


## Non-linear Data Structures

### Tree
**Traversals**:
- Depth-first search (DFS): Pre-order, In-order, Post-order
- Breadth-first search (BFS): Level-order

#### Binary Tree
**Types/Operation**s: isBinaryTree, isFullTree, isCompleteTree, isPerfectTree, isDegenerateTree, isBalancedTree, isLeftSkewed, isRightSkewed

#### Binary Search Tree
- Heap
  - Min-heap
  - Max-heap
- AVL Tree
  - **Operations**: Left Rotate, Right Rotate, Left-Right Rotate, Right-Left Rotate

#### B Tree
#### B+ Tree
#### Red-Black Tree

### Graphs
